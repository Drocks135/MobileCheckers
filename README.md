# MobileCheckers

### Overview
  For our project, we decided to focus on the Android platform for gaming. To do this, we decided to work specifically with Unity. Unity is an excellent real-time development platform in which the types of games the user can build are numerous. Unity also provides compatibility on over 25 different platform, including on both mobile and on desktop. For our project, we decided to create a game of checkers to show off what we learned about Unity. Unity allows us to use C# scripts to code checker pieces, moves, and the game mechanics in general to fit how we want. One big positive about Unity is how quickly and easy it is to create and modify Game Objects, as that is extremely helpful in loading up games and the moves the pieces make.
